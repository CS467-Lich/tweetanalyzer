# What is this directory?

We used this directory to store experiments and "how to" guides we wrote to share with our teammates (hence the name) before formalizing code into more polished packages. Some of the code you find here has not been implemented in the final product, but it was important in the process of developing our project. Even if we didn't use it, we still learned a lot from it!
